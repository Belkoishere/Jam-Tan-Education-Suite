The purpose of this project is to develop a centralised digital administration system to be used by a primary school and children’s club in rural Burkina Faso.

The school currently receives around 300 students with only 5 teachers and the children’s club receives around 700 children with only 10 staff as qualified teachers are limited in the area. 
All records taken by the school and kid’s club are paper based making administrative tasks and data analysis including identification of underperforming students slow and difficult given the sheer number of students.
Manual processes frequently lead to errors and poor communication which lead to incorrect student grouping, grading and forecasting.

By digitizing these processes, the system will enable faster, more accurate and efficient administration and data analysis enabling better decision making.
In the long term, this will free up staff and teachers to focus on education and student development helping every student reach their full potential.

Technologies that will be used:

Web server: XAMPP
Backend: SQL
Middle ware: PHP
Front end: HTML, CSS and JavaScript
Chart.Js: For visualising enrollment and attendance over time
